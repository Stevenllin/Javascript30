        let age2 = age;
        console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
        age = 200
        console.log(age, age2); // 100, 200

        // Let's say we have an array
        // 對陣列及物件來說，都是Reference
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players

        console.log(players, team); //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        team[3] = 'Lux';

        console.log(players, team); //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'], ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way
        const team2 = players.slice();

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];

        const team5 = Array.from(players);
        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

        // with Objects

        // and think we make a copy:

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age:12});
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
